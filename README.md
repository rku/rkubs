A simple text based multiplay battleships game.

This is one of my first programs. I wrote it around the year 2000
and recently rediscovered it. In 2006 I added a licence and put it
into this git repo. I keep it here for nostalgic reasons.

The game features…

* …multiplayer via tcp/ip network
* …ansi color support
* …simple cheat protection by commitment technique
